# angular-playground-light

I find myself frequently wanting to spawn up a crazy lightweight AngularJS set up in order to test something out. The Yeoman angular generator is overkill for this purpose - so here's a simple set up that can be cloned and ran with.

### Usage

1. `git clone git@github.com:mrjamesriley/angular-playground-light.git`
2. Get playing...
