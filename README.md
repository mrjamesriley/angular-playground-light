# angular-playground-light

I find myself frequently wanting to spawn up a crazy lightweight AngularJS set up in order to test something out. The Yeoman angular generator is overkill for this purpose - so here's a simple set up, using CDNs for the third-party assets, that can be cloned and ran with.

### Usage

1. `git clone git@github.com:mrjamesriley/angular-playground-light.git`
2. Get playing...

I have this set up as a bash alias:
`alias ap='git clone "git@github.com:mrjamesriley/angular-playground-light.git"; cd angular-playground-light'`

###Â Features

* Bootstrap 3.3
* AngularJS 1.3
* LiveReload snippet
